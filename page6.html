<p>There are roughly about 60.2 million Dog owners.</p>
<p>Where as there are only about 47.1 Cat owners.</p>
<p>Dog's can come in many shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Where as to Cat's really only come in one size(that's pretty boring if I say).</p>
<p>When you think of someone who owns a lot of dog's you don't think much of it or it to be weird and strange.</p>
<p>Yet when you think of owning a lot of cat's you then think about how owning a lot of cat's relate to a crazy cat lady and then you don't think owning cat's are cool anymore.</p>
<p>I mean after all Dog's are a 'man's' best-friend.</p>
