<p>Cat's ugh so awful, am I right ?</p>
<p>When you give a cat a name it is so pointless. All they will do is look at you all funny like you aren't talking to them.</p>
<p>They always have this resting mean looking face. It's like they are staring you down trying to take control over your body(so creepy right?).</p>
<p>When you first wake up in the morning they will be hovered over you with theis death stare like the had been staring at you all night trying to plot a plan to murder you and the fact that you wake up every morning makes their day crap.</p>
