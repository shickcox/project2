<p>Let's start off by going over some basic facts of why dogs are better than cats.</p>
<p>First fact is that when you call a dog's given name they will respond. They respond in ways such as, looking at you while they tilt their heads to the side and wage their tails or by walking / running toward you in a cute way with their adorable little faces.</p>
<p>Dog's will give you the best face licks and dog kisses ever.</p>
<p>You can train your dog to do almost any trick you want.
*they can go get you the things you want, you want them to get the paper / mail, then train them to and they will*</p>
<p>Dog's come in multiple sizes, from super duper small to really big and giant</p>
<p>Lastly Dog's can be used as an alarm clock in the morning, the best and cutest alarm clock ever.</p>
