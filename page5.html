<h1>* Here is some more on why Cat's just aren't better than Dog's *</h1>
<a href="index.html"> <img src="cvd-typeset.png"></a>
<p>Cat's look all cute and cuddly yet they barley even like to sleep in the same bed as you.</p>
<p>They will scratch you with there very sharp and pointy nails, people that it's a way of showing the care/love you but in my opinion that is just rude and only hurts.</p>
<p>Cat's are just straight boring, you can't play fetch with them or take them fr walks, how awful.</p>
